# DisjointSet
Easy and Clean Disjoint Set Data structure code using C++

Disjoint Set Data structure is used to find the ultimate parent of a node and also to create the graph dynamically.
The main beauty of the Disjoint Set is it tells for a given 2 nodes , weather they belongs to same component or not in constant time O(4alpha).
We use path Compression Technique.
Time Complexity of Disjoint Set DataStucture is O(4 alpha ) which is constant.
There are two types of Unions in Disjoint Set Data Structure Union By Rank and By size.
This is using Union By Rank.
